The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889. The tower is 330 meters tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and it was the tallest structure in France until the completion of the Millau Viaduct in 2004.

The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China. The Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. The most famous sections were built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
